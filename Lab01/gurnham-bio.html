        <title> Connor Gurnham - Bio </title>
    </head>

    <body>
    My name is Connor Gurnham and I am from Guilford CT. 
    I am 21 years old and halfway through my junior year at Syracuse University. 
    I am a Systems and Information Science Major with a minor in ECS management and an economics minor. 
    Throughout high school I was on varsity cross country, varsity skiing, and varsity tennis. 
    Freshman year in high school I became a firefighter, and I am still training to be a fully certified firefighter. 
    After my freshman year in college, I ran my own painting company in the summer where I was able to produce over $100k of painted houses. 
    I did this with a franchise called College Pro Painters where I received the Presidents Award for producing over $110k in sales and was able to keep above a 95% customer satisfaction rate. 
    On my free time I love hanging out with friends and playing sports like skiing in the winter or spikeball in the summer. 
    A unique interest I have is in middle school I learned to solve the rubix cube and now have a personal best time of 16 seconds. 
    Another fun fact is I was able to make the CT state ski team and had the honor to ski against the rest of the states in New England. 
    Thatâ€™s all about me!
